				<h2>It only took 12 years</h2>
				<h3>Excerpts from Adam's email/poem proposal to Danica. It tells the story of us.</h3>
				<p>A long time ago, it's been a while</p> 
				<p>Danica made Adam crack a smile</p> 
				<p>With what began what would be</p> 
				<p>11+ years of you and me</p> 
				<p>In that time</p>
				<p>So much did pass</p>
				<p>Stories to tell</p>
				<p>Laughs to be laughed</p> 
				<p>The camp of the day was DFC</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, camping outside of Shaver</p> 
				<p>was not meant to be</p> 
				<p>And though my dear Danica</p> 
				<p>This was the longest ago</p> 
				<p>It only took place in New Mexico</p> 
				<p>East we flew and back again</p>
				<p>Rocky Roads here did begin</p>
				<p>Life we explored</p> 
				<p>Each on a path of our own</p> 
				<p>Apart we did go</p>
				<p>Together was unknown</p> 
				<p>But time, it teaches you things</p> 
				<p>and before too long we were back wing and wing</p> 
				<p>Now two is good</p>
				<p>In fact, two is just fine</p>
				<p>There are two of many things</p>
				<p>Two is divine</p> 
				<p>But every now and again</p>
				<p>There does come a time</p>
				<p>Where two, though great</p>
				<p>Is no longer just fine</p>
				<p>So, (pet name for Danica), I've been thinking</p> 
				<p>And as much as thinking is fun</p>
				<p>I must admit</p>
				<p>I think it's time that two became one.</p>

		<h3>Awe! You are not seeing this site as it was intended!</h3> 
		<p>I really mean it, your browser is not capable of viewing this website properly.</p>
		<p>I'm Adam, yup, the groom.  You may not know me yet, or maybe you do, and somehow you don't KNOW me.</p>
		<p>I spend my days as a software developer, and a lot of the things I build end up on the web, like this site you are viewing now.</p>
		<p>What you may not know is that pretty much 100% of the headaches I have to deal with arise from supporting Internet Explorer (less than version 9).</p>
		<p>That is relevant, because you would not be seeing this message if you were not running Internet Explorer.</p>
		<p>If you don't know, let me kindly inform you that Internet Explorer (version 9 excluded), is by far the WORST, MOST HORRENDOUS browser you could be using to view the web.</p>
		<p>It's so bad, and since this site is partially an expression of myself, I am not supporting it at all.</p>
