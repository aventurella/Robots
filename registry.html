			<p>You shouldn't feel like you have to do anything. Seeing you at our wedding is gift enough. However, we know some of you will not be satiated until there is a registry and capitalism prevails. For those individuals, we provide the following and are grateful.  If you have a touch more socialism in you, we also give you the option of donating to a charity of our choosing at justgive.org.</p>

		<h3>Awe! You are not seeing this site as it was intended!</h3> 
		<p>I really mean it, your browser is not capable of viewing this website properly.</p>
		<p>I'm Adam, yup, the groom.  You may not know me yet, or maybe you do, and somehow you don't KNOW me.</p>
		<p>I spend my days as a software developer, and a lot of the things I build end up on the web, like this site you are viewing now.</p>
		<p>What you may not know is that pretty much 100% of the headaches I have to deal with arise from supporting Internet Explorer (less than version 9).</p>
		<p>That is relevant, because you would not be seeing this message if you were not running Internet Explorer.</p>
		<p>If you don't know, let me kindly inform you that Internet Explorer (version 9 excluded), is by far the WORST, MOST HORRENDOUS browser you could be using to view the web.</p>
		<p>It's so bad, and since this site is partially an expression of myself, I am not supporting it at all.</p>
