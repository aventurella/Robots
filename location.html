				<h2>Weather</h2>
				<div class="content">
					<p>Summer in Santa Fe is beautiful. There are some things, however, you should know.</p>
					<p>Santa Fe is considered the high desert, which basically means during the day it will be warm, 80-90s and no humidity. At night it will get cool, 60-70s, again no humidity, so you may want to have a light jacket handy.</p>
					<p>July is also monsoon season, you can thank Adam for the date, so you should also be prepared for rain. That being said, if it does rain it's over in a flash.</p>

				<h2>Getting There</h2>
				<div class="content">
					<p>The best way to get to Santa Fe is to fly into Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p>
					<p>Now, Sunrise Springs is not located in the heart of Santa Fe, it is just outside of it by about 10-15 minutes.</p>
					<p>From Albuquerque you hop on I-25 North towards Santa Fe. Exit 276B is your destination. After that you are about 1 left and a few right turns away. Rather than get into the details here, we have a handy map link for you.</p>

					<p>Lodging at Sunrise Springs the night of the wedding is highly recommended.</p>
					<p>We want you to be able to celebrate with us all night long and not have to worry about driving down windy roads back to your hotel in Santa Fe or home in ABQ intoxicated.</p>
					<p>Please call 800.955.0028 and book a room before June 22nd. Make sure you mention the Venturella/Amstadt Wedding Party (there are a lot of rooms set aside for us at special rates).</p>

		<p>I'm Adam, yup, the groom.  You may not know me yet, or maybe you do, and somehow you don't KNOW me.</p>
		<p>I spend my days as a software developer, and a lot of the things I build end up on the web, like this site you are viewing now.</p>
		<p>What you may not know is that pretty much 100% of the headaches I have to deal with arise from supporting Internet Explorer (less than version 9).</p>
		<p>That is relevant, because you would not be seeing this message if you were not running Internet Explorer.</p>
		<p>If you don't know, let me kindly inform you that Internet Explorer (version 9 excluded), is by far the WORST, MOST HORRENDOUS browser you could be using to view the web.</p>
		<p>It's so bad, and since this site is partially an expression of myself, I am not supporting it at all.</p>
