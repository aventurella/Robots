					<h2>Team Danica</h2>
					<h3>It's how I roll.</h3>
					<p>Albuquerque girl makes good in SoCal though she sometimes gets homesick for green chile, blue skies and adobe houses. Going to the beach helps her miss that less. Danica spends her days managing a Hollywood Day Spa and her nights playing Roller Derby with her teammates the Tough Cookies.  She also enjoys time hanging out with her family: Lucy (the dog), Olley (the cat) and Adam (the human and future hubby).  She likes to do anything outdoors, watch movies, and try out restaurants with large selections of yummy beverages on tap.</p>

					<h2>Team Adam</h2>
					<h3>Bla bla computers bla bla.</h3>
					<p>St.Louis boy makes good in SoCal. Adam spends his days in LA, Santa Monica specifically, with his dog Lucy, cat Ollie, and his wife Danica, who is also a LA Derby Doll; all girl banked track roller derby FTW!  He enjoys outdoor activities, specifically running, hiking, biking and training for adventure runs with other members of the BLITZ tech department, "If you haven't experienced 40 degree water, you haven't lived or been really, really, really cold." Oh and one more thing, he also loves interesting beer, the hoppier the better, in addition to occasionally brewing his own. Oh, and by the way, Team Danica stole my bio format.</p>
