						<h3>Meredith Wallis</h3>
						<p>Meredith and Danica became best friends at the ripe old age of 4 days, seriously! Needless to say, they have spent the rest of their 30+ years getting into all sorts of shenanigans from creating sweet dance routines in elementary school to exciting ski adventures in college.  After college, Meredith hid herself away in wet, but beautiful Juneau, Alaska for 7 years where she discovered that salmon is delicious, she's not very good at hockey, and 20 degree temperatures make for an excellent excuse to join a burlesque company.  Meredith currently resides in Portland, Oregon where she's being supported by her kitty cat Lucy as she finishes her training to become a certified nurse midwife.  Meredith is an avid outdoors woman, yoga enthusiast, fan of young adult literature, and loves a good dance party like nobody's business!  Little known fact: Meredith is also small enough to fit into a 1/2 sized gym locker, and will wait to pounce on anyone who opens said locker. Be AFRAID, she's feisty!</p>

						<h3>Zoë Cooper</h3>
						<p>When you don't put the umlaut  over the ë in Zoë it makes her very angry. You do not want to make her angry because overall Zoë has a very cheery disposition and only a real jerk would make someone so sweet angry.  Zoë &amp; Danica became the best of pals back in middle school and Zoë hasn't been able to shake Danica off since then. Zoë currently resides in Albuquerque, New Mexico with her new hubby Matt Cooper and her two dogs Bella and Suka. Zoë is currently in residency as a burgeoning physical therapist inspired by her athletic pursuits including but not limited to running, hiking, biking, rock climbing, and any other crazy nature activities invented by humans. Zoë is also the most well traveled person Danica knows and has led her through the altiplano of Chile on extreme adventures that included almost freezing to death, eating alpaca &amp; having gypsies curse their lives over a ham sandwich.</p>

		<h3>Awe! You are not seeing this site as it was intended!</h3> 
		<p>I really mean it, your browser is not capable of viewing this website properly.</p>
		<p>I'm Adam, yup, the groom.  You may not know me yet, or maybe you do, and somehow you don't KNOW me.</p>
		<p>I spend my days as a software developer, and a lot of the things I build end up on the web, like this site you are viewing now.</p>
		<p>What you may not know is that pretty much 100% of the headaches I have to deal with arise from supporting Internet Explorer (less than version 9).</p>
		<p>That is relevant, because you would not be seeing this message if you were not running Internet Explorer.</p>
		<p>If you don't know, let me kindly inform you that Internet Explorer (version 9 excluded), is by far the WORST, MOST HORRENDOUS browser you could be using to view the web.</p>
		<p>It's so bad, and since this site is partially an expression of myself, I am not supporting it at all.</p>
